#Moti Readme


##About

Moti is a new kind of interactive smart toy: it's a spherical robot specially designed for children with autism.


##Why Github?

Because our team is not located in one single place, we needed a way to distribute the process of prototyping so that everyone could try it at home, debug it and create new features.

At first, we wanted to keep the code for ourselves. But then we thought "hey! our project is great, but wouldn't it be better if a lot of people could fork it, add their modifications, features, improvements, and then share it back to the community?"

For us, the answer is an absolute YES! We want people to be able to look at our code, use it for their projects, use it to build their own Moti and then get back to us to improve the awesomeness for a better world today!


##Actual Version

The actual development version is v2.0, it uses the MOTI Class and Makefiles.

It is also used with our 2nd and 3rd prototypes. They use special sensors as described [here](./sketch/README.md)

The new v1.0 version is a little more expensive than v0.1, so do not hesitate to fork the master branch tagged 0.1 to continue the development of v0.1 cheaper version.


##Branches

*	`master` is the stable branch for production and tests.
*	`dev` (origin HEAD) is the development branch for unit/lab tests and behaviour development. if the lab tests are concluding, a pull request to the master can be made.
*	`feature branches` are transitory branches used to develop new features to incorporate to the dev branch. when the feature is bugless, a pull request may be made to merge the concluding results inside the dev branch.
*	`oldies` branch keeps all the old code and libraries we used for the first prototype. It is deprecated now but could be help full for beginners.


##How to install

The full procedure is detailed in [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md). It has been written for beginners as well as for advanced hackers.


##How to use

The full procedure on how to use everything you've just installed is described in [USE.md](./USE.md).


##Known Issues

###Moti 2 - v1.0

*	none yet (we're so cool!)

###Moti 1 - v0.1

*	the speed and the light depend on the excitement of the robot, but when the motors are running, moti is exciting itself perpetually... need to change that!



##TODO

*	Implement the todo list...

##Leka would like to thank

Our team would like to thank with all our hearts [Vincent Thiberville](http://www.vincent-thiberville.com/) for his kind work on our first prototype.
Without him nothing would have been possible!

Robot Readme
=======================

*	The code presented here is a property of Leka Smart Toys.


Summary
-------

robot is the code name of our first home made prototype of Moti.


About
-----

Because our team is not located in one single place, we needed a way to distribute the process of prototying so that everyone could try it at home, debug it, create new features and improve the awesomeness for a better world today!


Branches
------------

*	master is the stable branch for production and tests on the children.
*	dev is the development branch for unit/lab tests and behaviour developpment. if the lab tests are concluding, a pull request to the master can be made.
*	raw is the "original" branch. it containes all the original source files. those are very, very, very important and can save us in case something goes wrong. Therefore, it is absolutely forbidden to use and/or modify the raw branch. Be advised!
*	feature branches are transitory branches used to developp new features to incorporate to the dev branch. when the feature is bugless, a pull request may be made to merge the concluding results inside the dev branch.


Known Issues
------------

*	none yet (we're so cool!)
